Proxstar
===========

Proxstar is a proxmox VM web management tool used by [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://rit.edu/)'s [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu).

## Overview

Written using [Python](http://nodejs.org), [Flask](https://npmjs.com).

Proxstar removes the need for CSH members to have direct access to the proxmox web interface.

Proxstar is also used to enforce proxmox resource limits automagically.

It is available to house members at [proxstar.csh.rit.edu](https://proxstar.csh.rit.edu) behind PYOIDC authentication.
