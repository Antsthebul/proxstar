# proxstar

Proxstar is a proxmox VM web management tool used by [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu).
<br>
Written in Python Flask, proxstar removes the need for CSH members to have direct access to the proxmox web
interface.
<br>
Proxstar is also used to enforce proxmox resource limits automagically.
<br>
Available to house members at <code>proxstar.csh.rit.edu</code> behind PYOIDC authentication.
